/**
 * The DeepSeek Harness backend.
 *
 * The default export is what a registration document's `module` resolves to:
 * the backend wired to the real SDK driver. Without it the registry loads this
 * module, finds no backend-shaped export, and rejects the registration — so a
 * deployment could name this module in `.pi/teammate-backends.json` and never
 * reach the runtime.
 *
 * The SDK client loads with the driver on first run, not with this module. A
 * host that only reads the capability table or the configuration fields — the
 * settings shell does exactly that, on every session — would otherwise pay for
 * a transport it never opens.
