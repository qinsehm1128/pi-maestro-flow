/**
 * The ACP-CLI backend: run one external CLI that speaks the Agent Client
 * Protocol, over the same `TeammateBackend` contract every other backend uses.
 *
 * Generic by construction. Nothing here names a particular CLI: the executable,
 * its argv, its working directory, and its ssh connection are configuration
 * fields, so adding a CLI that speaks ACP needs no host source change. One
 * registration serves one CLI, which is what lets two of them declare different
 * routes and different timeouts.
 *
 * Two documents, each sufficient for one thing and neither for both. A
 * registration in `.pi/teammate-backends.json` is necessary and sufficient to
 * *run* `cli/<tool>`: the launch takes its configuration from the registration
 * and reads no file. An entry in `teammate-cli-tools.json` is necessary and
 * sufficient for `cli/<tool>` to *appear* in the model catalog, which is all the
 * host still derives from that file. So a registered tool missing from the tools
 * file runs when a task names it and is never offered, and a tool present only
 * in the tools file is offered and then refused by name — including one the
 * tools file marks `enabled: false`, because the registration is the enablement
 * decision.
 *
 * It ships in this package because its implementation reuses this package's ACP
 * driver and CLI launch helpers, and it is registered by module specifier like
 * any third-party adapter — the host loader has no branch for it.
 *
 * Recovery facts travel on the returned outcome. The dispatch path this backend
 * replaces fed them through a `WeakMap` keyed on the result, with a hardcoded
 * zero completed-tool count: a CLI run that edited files and then failed was
 * reported as having touched nothing, so the host's replay fence cleared a
 * replay that would repeat those edits.

 * What driving an external CLI over ACP actually serves.

 * `outputSchema` — the ACP prompt turn carries no schema and this backend adds
 * no host-side extraction, so a task asking for one is rejected by capability
 * adjudication before anything is spawned. The dispatch this replaces made the
 * same decision inside the run, after the config had been loaded.
 * `forkContext` — a Pi history entry describes a different runtime's tool set.
 * `modelSelection` — honoured on both axes. The registration is the route, and a
 * spec naming anything else names a model in the CLI's own catalogue, which
 * `start` selects on the session it opens. A value that CLI does not advertise
 * fails the run rather than silently leaving the agent on its current model.
 * `thinkingLevel` — no ACP field expresses it; the CLI's own config decides.
 * `todoBinding` — this backend passes no host tool to the child, so a task with
 * todos would stall at `in_progress` while the host waited for updates.
 * `toolFilter` — the CLI's own configuration owns its tool set.
 * `steer` — the driver has no mid-turn injection, and queueing to a turn
 * boundary is not built here.
 * `followUp` — one prompt per run; the process exits with the turn.
 * `abort` — `BackendRun.abort()` aborts the signal the driver cancels on, which
 * cancels the ACP session and tears down the process.
